# User Centered Design

Our User Centered Design approach has 6 elements to its process.

## Research

Front end research includes a review of existing documentation, user manuals, academic research, etc. It lays the ground work for designs and establishing requirements based on users' needs. Generative UX Research is an ongoing process. Methods may include interviews, focus groups, cognitive-walkthroughs, and/or heuristic evaluations.

## User Models

User models include task flows, [personas] (Personas), scenarios, communication models, and mental models. These artifacts enable designers and developers to understand what the users need operationally to accomplish the mission at hand, and what information they need to make decisions and complete tasks. We generated two personas for the MedExplorer project, [Kent Nelson, Doctor] (Personas/ADF_Doctor_Persona_06202015.pdf) and [Emma Jones, Consumer] (Personas/ADF_Consumer_Persona_06202015.pdf).

## User Stories

User research ensures user stories are valid by identifying user priorities. As new information emerges, stories are refined and re-prioritized. These stories will inform the product backlog for future Agile sprints, as well as completion criteria.

## Wireframes & Prototypes

Designers create [wireframes] (Wireframes) and low fidelity prototypes. Interaction designs are produced and regularly are brought into the scrums to facilitate feasibility conversations with developers.

#### Design Ideas

The design group processed the generative research and user stories to produce initial designs, interfaces that could be used to achieve the stated goals.  Designers also arrange and configure information and how it is displayed to make the most important data the most visible.

#### Initial Wireframes

We refined and combined our Design Ideas into a single draft wireframe that was reviewed by the entire team. The initial wireframe is located at [Wireframes/Initial Wireframes] (Wireframes/Initial Wireframes/wireframe_v01_06202015.pdf).

## Evaluation

We conducted usability studies with real users, to verify user models and design decisions. Various evaluation methods include interviews, expectancy tests, comparison testing, and focus groups to measure efficiency, accuracy, and user satisfaction.

#### Final Wireframes

The user feedback and designs were shown to developers in ongoing discussions during each sprint to ensure the designsâ€™ deliverability.  The designs were altered to meet the user expectations and to be executable within the sprint schedule, resulting in the Final Wireframes.

## Design Documentation

Design documentation was produced to help the developers understand the design group decisions, how the product was meant to look, feel, and behave.  Color schemes, font choices, and design patterns are included in the project style guide and Design Documentation.
