Docker setup:

1. Download and run docker-install.exe (found at: 
   https://github.com/boot2docker/windows-installer/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

2. Pull the centos git repository at https://github.com/centos/centos-dockerfiles to your local 
   machine and record the location you placed this repository. You can use any git program you prefer.

3. Open the start menu, and open 'All Programs'->'Docker'->'Boot2Docker start'. This will start 
   a VM that is running Docker.
   
4. Open VirtualBox and open the settings for the boot2docker-vm. On the sidebar, click 'Network', 
   and then click on 'Port Forwarding'. Create a new port and set both 'Host Port' and 'Guest Port'
   to 8080. The rest of the fields can be left to there default values.
   
5. Once the VM finishes loading, you will be given a command prompt. In this prompt, navigate to 
   the directory repo_location/centos-dockerfiles/nodejs/centos6.
   
   You should find the following files:
		Dockerfile  LICENSE  README.md  index.js  package.json
		
6. Run the command:    docker build -rm -t <username>/nodejs:centos6 .
   
   Replace <username> with your username and note the dot at the end. This will build nodejs 
   application.
   
7. Run the command:    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <username>/nodejs:centos6
   
   Make sure <username> matches the <username> you use in the previous command. This will run the 
   application.

8. Run the command:    docker ps
   
   This will give you information on the running applications. You should see the nodejs application
   in this list (the IMAGES field will be <username>/nodejs:centos6).
   
9. Go to your browser and open http://localhost:8080. You should see the following message:
   
      Hello World from CentOS6 in Docker
   
	If so, then Docker has successfully been stood up. All the commands above can also be found in 
	repo_location/centos-dockerfiles/nodejs/centos6/README.md
