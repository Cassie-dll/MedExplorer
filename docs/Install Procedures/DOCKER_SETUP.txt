Docker setup:

This readme assumes that you are running Boot2Docker on Windows

1. Open the start menu, and open 'All Programs'->'Docker'->'Boot2Docker start'. This will start 
   a VM that is running Docker.
   
2. Open VirtualBox and open the settings for the boot2docker-vm. On the sidebar, click 'Network', 
   and then click on 'Port Forwarding'. Create a new port and set both 'Host Port' and 'Guest Port'
   to 8080. The rest of the fields can be left to there default values.
   
3. Once the VM finishes loading, you will be given a command prompt. In this prompt, navigate to 
   the "MedExplorer/src/server" directory. You should find Dockerfile inside of this directory.
		
4. Run the command:    docker build --rm -t <username>/nodejs:centos6 .
   
   Replace <username> with your username and note the dot at the end. This will build nodejs 
   application.
   
5. Run the command:    docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 10050:10050 --name nodejs <username>/nodejs:centos6
   
   Make sure <username> matches the <username> you use in the previous command. This will run the 
   application.

6. Run the command:    docker ps
   
   This will give you information on the running applications. You should see the nodejs application
   in this list (the IMAGES field will be <username>/nodejs:centos6).
   
7. Go to your browser and open http://localhost. You should see the MedExplorer client
