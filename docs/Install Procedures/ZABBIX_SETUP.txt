Zabbix setup

1. Deploy the Zabbix docker image by running the command "docker run -d -p 10051:10051 -p 10052:10052 -p 9001:80 -p 2812:2812 --name zabbix  berngp/docker-zabbix".

NOTE: If Zabbix is to be run on a public facing internet site, update the following section "-p 9001:80" to be in the following format "-p <EXTERNAL_IP_OF_SERVER>:9001:80".
Replace the <EXTERNAL_IP_OF_SERVER> with the external IP address of the server.

2. Get local 80 port mapping by running "docker ps -f name=zabbix"  Find the port that is mapped to 80 for this container.

3. If VirtualBox is installed, open VirtualBox and open the settings for the boot2docker-vm. On the sidebar, click 'Network', 
   and then click on 'Port Forwarding'. Create a new port and set both 'Host Port' and 'Guest Port'
   to the port mapped to 9001. The rest of the fields can be left to there default values.
   
4. Ensure that Zabbix is started by running the following command "docker ps". An entry for Zabbix should be listed.
   
5. Go to the Zabbix server (http://localhost:9001/zabbix). Note that the URL is case sensitive (lower case zabbix).
The default credentials for Zabbix are username: Admin and password: zabbix. Both username and password are case sensitive.

If the Zabbix site does not display in the browser, make sure that port 9001 (or the port specified when Zabbix was installed) is not blocked.
