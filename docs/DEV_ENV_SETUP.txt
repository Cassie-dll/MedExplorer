1)  clone git project from git.triad.local/NorthropGrumman/FDAExplorer

2)  install node from https://nodejs.org
      -- this will install node and npm (node package manager)

3)  install express globally using "npm install -g express"
      -- the -g flag will install the node module globally,
          such as in the "User\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules" directory
      -- installing a module without the -g flag will place it in the
          node_modules directory inside of the project

4)  install bower globally using "npm install -g bower"
      -- bower is the front end package manager, where a lot of the
          angularjs plug-ins/dependencies/tools can be grabbed from

5)  install grunt globally using "npm install -g grunt-cli"
      -- grunt is a useful tool for running the node server and
          doing some debugging. I think there are different profiles
          that you can configure to run the node server with during
          development
      -- NOTE: if the grunt command will not run because it is not found,
          you must close and re-open your command window

6)  open a command window, cd to the "src/server" directory, and run
    "npm install"

7)  cd to the "src/client" directory and run "npm install && bower install"

8)  to build the front end, you must cd to the "src/client" directory
    and run "grunt"
      -- this will compile all of the front end files into the
          "src/server/dist" folder

9)  to run the node server, cd to the "src/server" directory and
    run "nodemon app.js". Then visit "http://localhost:80" in your browser.
      -- this starts the node server, which hosts the front end out of the
          "src/server/dist" folder onto localhost over port 3000

NOTE: nodemon will re-deploy the node server when any changes are made,
      automatically
      
      while developing the client, you can use grunt to host and update any
      changes you make to the front end code, automatically. To do this, cd
      to the "src/client" directory and run "grunt serve". This should open
      a window in your browser at "localhost:9000". This window will
      automatically refresh when changes are made! When you are finished
      developing,  run "update.bat" to update your front-end changes on 
      the node server.

      "grunt serve" hosts the client on "localhost:9000" completely separate
      from the node server, so these changes will not show up on
      "localhost:80" until you run "update.bat"

10) cd to the src/server directory
	install mongodb with the command "npm install mongodb"
	This required me to install python 2.7.10 found here
	https://www.python.org/downloads/
	and set the PYTHON environment variable with the commands:
	"set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\Python27"
	"set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe"
	
	and to install Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Software Development Kit found here
	http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/Download/details.aspx?id=19988
	
	and to install Microsoft visual studio .net based on the instructions found here
	https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki/Visual-Studio-2010-Setup
	this required me to log into as a microsoft user
	
	Don't forget to restart the cmd shell after installing software
