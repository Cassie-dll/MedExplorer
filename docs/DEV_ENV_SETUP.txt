1)  clone git project from git.triad.local/NorthropGrumman/FDAExplorer

2)  install node from https://nodejs.org
      -- this will install node and npm (node package manager)

3)  install express globally using "npm install -g express"
      -- the -g flag will install the node module globally,
          such as in the "User\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules" directory
      -- installing a module without the -g flag will place it in the
          node_modules directory inside of the project

4)  install bower globally using "npm install -g bower"
      -- bower is the front end package manager, where a lot of the
          angularjs plug-ins/dependencies/tools can be grabbed from

5)  install grunt globally using "npm install -g grunt-cli"
      -- grunt is a useful tool for running the node server and
          doing some debugging. I think there are different profiles
          that you can configure to run the node server with during
          development

6)  open a command window, cd to the "src/server" directory, and run
    "npm install"

7)  cd to the "src/client" directory and run "npm install && bower install"

8)  to stand up the web app, cd to the "src/client" directory and run
    "grunt serve"
      -- this should stand it up at localhost:9000/#/
