![Agile User Centered Approach](docs/Diagrams/Agile User Centered%20Approach.png)
Our Agile User-Centered approach ensures ongoing collaboration between development team, users, and multiple stakeholders.  Todo:[Team picture]   To implement our framework we first identified the members of [our team and the roles](docs/MedExplorer Development Team.md) they would fulfil.  Our multidisciplinary team is comprised of experienced User Experience (UX) designers, product manager, software and test engineers, delivery manager, agile coach, and business owners. Our product, Medicine Explorer, is designed for the general public and clinicians who seek information on pharmaceutical (prescription and over the counter drugs) performance so they can make better health decisions. Our product supports multiple device platforms and provides searchable information and trends on pharmaceuticals and related adverse effects which is unlike other similar sites. Our product provides authoritative, trustworthy, and objective information.

To kick off the initiative, the team collaborated to review the RFQ details to ensure we understood the requirements and to set expectations.

One of the first activities for the team was to review and analyze the multiple data sets (Drugs, Devices, Foods) provided on [openFDA](http://open.FDA.gov) website. As part of our initial research we provided a summary of our analysis of the data to our Northrop Grumman Corporate Medical Advisory Board for input as to which sets of information they would find more useful as clinicians. Following this we met with a domain expert working in the Health Care industry and representatives from the general public to understand what information would better met their needs. This lays the initial groundwork for understanding the user space and what information would be of value. Based on this feedback, we decided to focus on the data sets associated with Drugs (Adverse Events, Labeling, and Enforcement Reports).

The next step in our Agile UX approach, was to use the feedback and learning in the initial research phase to develop our [product vision](docs/Pictures/Draft Vision Statement.jpg) and [personas](docs/User Centered Design/Personas). We created two personas, [Clinician] (docs/User Centered Design/Personas/ADF_Doctor_Persona_06202015.pdf) and [General Public](docs/User Centered Design/Personas/ADF_Consumer_Persona_06202015.pdf) users. These personas along with understanding the information that deemed important during our initial research phase allowed the Product Manager with the team to draft our [product vision](docs/Pictures/Draft Vision Statement.jpg) and [product name](docs/Pictures/Product Name Brainstorming.jpg). The draft version of our vision helped communicate with users and domain experts the problem we are trying to solve. After a walkthrough of the vision with our stakeholders we were able to refine it with  more clarity around who the product is for, what it provides, and its differentiating factors. The team then focused on a name for our new product. The team brainstormed a list of potential names that aligned with the vision. We spent time researching the name to ensure it was not already in use or in conflict with an existing product or company, and then using a voting technique, each [team member voted](docs/Pictures/DotVoting.jpg) on their top three favorites. This resulted in our product name, Medicine Explorer or [MedExplorer](http://MedExplorer.northropgrumman.com).

To better understand the needs of the users (Clinicians and General Public), we used proven [user-centered design](docs/User Centered Design/User Centered Design.md) practices to conduct interviews, create user models to allow designers and developers to imagine what the user needs operationally to accomplish the mission at hand. This input helped the team to generate an initial product backlog of stories.

Our [Agile process](docs/Software Development/Processes#agile-user-centered-design) included 2 sprints per day and [periodic standups](docs/Pictures/Morning Standup.jpg) to address concerns and impediments. Each sprint was comprised of sprint planning, sprint execution, and a sprint review which included a demonstration of working functionality and other sprint results such a feedback from users as we continued to validate our designs and results. During the sprints the UX team members met with users to conduct [expectancy tests](docs/User Centered Design/User Centered Design.md#evaluation). This is a basic test that helps the team understand how intuitive the features in the product are and whether layouts need to be modified.  The challenge during this release was to consider the "minimal viable product" that we want to product that provides the best initial value to the users. This caused us to focus on the feature prioritization and move some of the stories into the next release. Regular sprint demonstrations provided the opportunity to show continuous progress of a working product to our users and to our external stakeholders who supported our efforts. Based on feedback from the review and the regular feedback from our users, we were able to reprioritize our backlog each sprint and ensure we are focused on the high value items.

During sprint execution we implemented our [DevOps](docs/Software Development/Processes#devops) approach emphasizing the importance of continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring. This enabled us to regularly test our features as they were developed and build a more sustainable product.
