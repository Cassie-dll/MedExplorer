![Agile User Centered Approach](docs/Diagrams/Agile User Centered%20Approach.png)

Our Agile User-Centered approach ensures ongoing collaboration between development team, users, and stakeholders. Todo:[Team picture] To implement our [framework](docs/Software Development/Processes/Readme.md) we first identified the members of [our team and the roles](docs/MedExplorer Development Team.md) they would fulfil. Our multidisciplinary team is comprised of experienced user experience (UX) designers, [product manager (PM)](docs/MedExplorer Development Team.md), software and test engineers, delivery manager, agile coach, and business owners. Our product, Medicine Explorer, is designed for the general public and clinicians who seek information on pharmaceutical (prescription and over the counter) performance so they can make better health decisions. The product supports [multiple device platforms](docs/Software Development/Screenshots/Platforms) and provides searchable information and trends on pharmaceuticals and related adverse effects. Our goal is to provide authoritative, trustworthy, and objective information to our users.

With the team we collaborated to review the RFQ details to ensure we understood the requirements and to set expectations. Part of the activities ([Sprint 0](docs/Pictures/Sprint0activities.jpg)) for the team was to review and analyze multiple data sets and API (Drugs, Devices, Foods) provided at [openFDA](http://open.FDA.gov). As part of the initial research we provided an analysis of the data to the Northrop Grumman Corporate Medical Advisory Board for input as to which sets of information would be more useful by clinicians. We also met with a domain expert in the Health Care industry and representatives from the general public to understand what information would better met their needs. This was the groundwork for understanding the user and what information would be of value. Based on feedback, we decided to focus on the data sets associated with Drugs (Adverse Events, Labeling, and Enforcement Reports). As the lead decision maker the PM agreed to this decision and gave the permission to proceed.

Next the team used the feedback and learning in the initial research phase to develop our [product vision](docs/Vision Statement.md) and [personas](docs/User Centered Design/Personas). We created two personas, [Clinician] (docs/User Centered Design/Personas/Persona_Clinician.png) and [General Public](docs/User Centered Design/Personas/Persona_General_Public.png). Using the personas the Product Manager with the team revised our [product vision](docs/Vision Statement.md) and created a [product name](docs/Pictures/Product Name Brainstorming.jpg). The draft version of our vision helped communicate with users and domain experts the problem we are trying to solve. After a walkthrough of the vision with our stakeholders we were able to refine it with more clarity around who the product is for, what it provides, and its differentiating factors. To create a product name the team brainstormed a list of names that aligned with the vision. We spent time researching name options to ensure it was not already in use or in conflict with an existing product or company, and then using a voting technique, each [team member voted](docs/Pictures/DotVoting.jpg) on their top three favorites. This resulted in our product name, Medicine Explorer or [MedExplorer](http://MedExplorer.northropgrumman.com).

To better understand the needs of the users (Clinicians and General Public), we used proven [user-centered design](docs/User Centered Design/Readme.md) practices to conduct interviews, create user models, and develop style guides so designers and developers better understand the user needs operationally. We also created designs for [multiple devices](docs/Software Development/Screenshots/Platforms) for users to review. With user input the team generated an initial backlog of stories.

Our [Agile process](docs/Software Development/Processes#agile-user-centered-design) focused on iterative development which included 2 sprints per day and [periodic standups](docs/Pictures/Morning Standup.jpg) to address concerns and impediments as we developed the [prototype](License.md). Each sprint was comprised of planning, execution, and a review including a demonstration of working functionality and sharing of sprint results such a feedback from users as we continued to validate designs and results.

Sprint planning was a time to focus on the goal(s) for the sprint. During sprint execution team members met with users to conduct __usability__ and [expectancy tests](docs/User Centered Design/Readme.md#evaluation). These tests helped the team understand how intuitive the features are, whether layouts need to be modified, and how well the features meet user expectations. Our challenge was to identify the "minimum viable product" that we would provide for the first release. This caused us to focus on feature prioritization and move some stories into the [next release](docs/Diagrams/MedExplorer Product Roadmap.png).  We used [open-source technologies](License.md) throughout development and as part of our [DevOps](docs/Software Development/Processes#devops) practices. Practices included [unit testing](docs/Software%20Development/Processes/DevOps.md#automated-test), continuous integration(docs/Software%20Development/Processes/DevOps.md#continuous-integration), source code management((docs/Software%20Development/Processes/DevOps.md#source-code-management)), and [continuous delivery](docs/Software%20Development/Processes/DevOps.md#continuous-deliverydeployment) and [monitoring](docs/Software%20Development/Processes/DevOps.md#continuous-monitoring). We also included [install procedures](docs/Install Procedures) to support the deploy process. This enabled us to regularly test features as they were developed and build a more sustainable product. Regular demonstrations provided continuous progress of a working product to our users (internal and __IaaS provider__). Based on review feedback, we regularly reprioritized our backlog with focus on the high value items. Our detailed evidence is highlighted below.
