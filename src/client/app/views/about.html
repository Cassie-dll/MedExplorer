				Medicine Explorer is for the general public and clinicians
					who seek drug information (over the counter and prescription) for
					making better health decisions. The site uses datasets from <strong><u><a
					href="https://open.fda.gov/">openFDA</a></u></strong> to provide easy access to
					public data relating to adverse events, product labeling, and
					recall enforcement reports.

			<p>
			<h3>General Public example use</h3>
				<em>You pick up a decongestant
					from the pharmacy but remember that some may interact negatively
					with your high blood pressure prescription. With Medicine Explorer,
					you can easily search on your blood pressure medication and
					navigate to the drug interaction information and scan the results
					for interaction with over the counter medications. Also, you can
					see the potential side effects of the medications to make an
					informed decision.</em>

			<h3>Clinician example use</h3>
				<em>As a doctor, use Medicine Explorer
					to help decide which over the counter medications would be safe for
					your patients to take. Through the site, you have the option to
					view adverse reaction data regarding medications. While reviewing
					reported issues, you also have the capability to inspect At Risk
					Population data and see if a drug is safe to prescribe to patients
					who are pregnant. Allowing you to be assure that the medicine is
					safe with low risk of complications for your patients. </em>
